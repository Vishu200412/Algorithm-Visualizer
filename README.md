# Algorithm Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is a web application that allows users to visually explore various sorting and pathfinding algorithms. This project provides an interactive interface where users can observe the step-by-step execution of algorithms, gaining a deeper understanding of their mechanics and efficiency.

## Features

- **Sorting Visualizer**: Explore various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort and Insertion Sort. Visualize how each algorithm sorts a randomly generated array of elements.

- **Pathfinding Visualizer**: Visualize popular pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, BFS and DFS. Watch as the algorithm finds the shortest path between two points on a grid.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **React Router**: Used for handling routing within the application, enabling navigation between different views.

- **CSS**: Styling is done using CSS to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the specified port if different).

## Usage

- Upon opening the application, you will be greeted with the home page displaying two options: Sorting Visualizer and Pathfinding Visualizer.
- Click on "Sorting Visualizer" to explore sorting algorithms visually. You can choose different algorithms from the dropdown menu and visualize their execution.
- Click on "Pathfinding Visualizer" to visualize pathfinding algorithms in action. Select the algorithm and draw obstacles on the grid to see how the algorithm finds the shortest path.
